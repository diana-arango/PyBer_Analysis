# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This report showcases the differences between city types based on the total weekly fares, charged during January 2019 to April 2019. For the analysis, it will be applied the knowledge acquired during the module regarding DataFrames, series, pandas and Matplotlib, types of visualization and the usage of pandas functions such as groupby(), count() and sum(). The study will help the CEO of Pyber to take a decision regarding the improvement of access to ridesharing services and the affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Results
1.	Differences in ride-sharing data among cities:
a.	From a total of 2375 rides, Urban cities enjoyed most of the rides in comparison with rural cities that only had 125. However Suburban cities totalized a number of 625 rides
b.	From a total of 2973 drivers; 2405 belong to urban cities, 490 to Suburban and 78 to rural cities. Urban cities possessed almost 31 times more drivers than rural cities
c.	Fares appeared to be more expensive in rural cities than urban however Suburban are just $4.60 different than rural cities 
d.	Similarly, the average fare per ride and driver are considerably higher in rural sites than urban cities. Suburban cities are $9.00 over than their average fare per ride count

2.	Based on the multiple-line chart, it can be determined that the total fares performance in each city type is constant during the studied period. A pick in the values of total fares per city was presented during the end of February, the rest of the year looked stable, only showing some volatility for the urban cities but not out of the range of $2000 to $2500 as its maximum. Nevertheless, The discrepancies among cities is impressive. Rural cities have the poorest performance in comparison with urban cities, tending to lower further in time. Suburban cities however, maintained their middle position, commiting their fares between $700 to $1500; not presenting the lowest total rate as rural cities but either close to urban cities counts.

### Summary

Understanding that every city type has their own constrain such as access, population, and economic activity to consider when investing in improvement, I recommend studying suburban cities in more detail to determine if more rides can be offered based on their growth expectation and reduce their fare values to increase their ridesharing services access. In regards of rural cities, I suggest studying if the rides running already, cover most neighborhoods then determine if there are underserved communities, their ability to afford rides and their necessity to use the service, if so, more rides should be implemented. Finally, I advise to consider the number of rides at urban cities to conclude if they are sufficient need to be removed or need to be adjusted
